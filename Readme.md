   You can check by running `php -v` in your terminal.

2. **Save the code in a file called `basket.php`.**

3. **Open a terminal and run:**
   ```
   php basket.php
   ```

4. **When prompted, type product codes separated by spaces.**  
   For example:
   ```
   R01 G01 B01
   ```
   Then press Enter.

   --- Basket Summary ---
   Subtotal: $65.85
   Discounts: -$0.00
   Delivery: $2.95
   Total: $68.80
   ```

   If you enter two R01s, youâ€™ll see the discount applied:
   ```

   ```

   Output:
   ```
